	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>
		The Text Twist game has never tracked anything about anyone, and will never do so.
	</p>
	<h1>Feedback Email</h1>
	<p>
		The app contains an email address to send me feedback. However, due to time and interest constraints I am unlikely to read those. In case I do receive an email from you that implies consent to read. I usually delete all Text Twist email every moth or so.
	</p>
	<h1>App Details</h1>
	<p>
		You can find the latest source code of the app on <a href="https://github.com/niven/texttwist">GitHub</a>. All source code and assets are in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Public Domain</a>
