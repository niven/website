	<h1>Zombicide: Green Horde Fatty</h1>
		<p>
		<img src="img/zombicide_green_horde_fatty_base_colors.jpg" alt="Zombicide: Green Horde Fatty" width="80%"><br><span>Base colors</span><br>
		These are basically the same as the Walkers, except with purple robes, and some kind of quirky neckerchief. Fashionable Orks these! They also carry around some skulls, and I thought it would be nice to put some Khorne Red into their wounds.

	<h1>Zombicide: Green Horde Walkers</h1>
		<p>
		<img src="img/zombicide_green_horde_walkers_primed.jpg" alt="Zombicide: Green Horde Walkers primed Death Guard Green" width="80%"><br><span>Primed with Death Guard Green</span><br>
		I'm going to first do a heavy drybrush of Loren Forest on all the skin. Then everything leather in Zandri Dust, metal in Runefang Steel, bone in Screaming Skull and any robes and things Khorne Red for contrast. That will leave everything very bright which I think fits well enough with the exaggerated poses and look of these Orks. Then everything gets shaded over with Agrax Eartshade and then maybe some easy highlights for the faces and things. I'm not going to bother doing anything for the tongues, I can always splash some Blood for the Blood God on it after I buy it.
		<p>
		<img src="img/zombicide_green_horde_walkers_base_colors.jpg" alt="Zombicide: Green Horde Walkers with base colors" width="80%"><br><span>Base colors applied</span><br>
		Teeth look pretty horrible in this close up, but from armslength it looks nice. I did two thin coats&trade; for everything except the cloth. There I just fixed mistakes and did the raised areas, kind of a pre highlight. The ripped up cloth is a pain to paint but looks quite nice I think.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="img/zombicide_green_horde_walkers_finished.jpg" alt="Zombicide: Green Horde Walkers finished" width="80%"><br><span>End result. They are all posed like they are about to sing. Backstreet Orks.</span><br>
		I painted the bases with Administratum Grey and the tiles with Balor Brown and Rakarth Flesh for variation. The Brown ended up being much warmen and brighter than I liked, so I applied a wash of Nuln Oil mixed with Agrax Earthshade after the first wash of just Agrax Earthshade had dried. I think I more desaturated brown/yellow would work better.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did a little bit of highlighting of the skin with Loren Forest and Loren Forest mixed with Ionrach Skin since that is a very pale mint like color that works well for zombie skin. I only did the face, tips of the ears, nose and chin to attract some attention there. These are all on the board on bulk so it doesn't really matter, but it's nice to do for fun. Also hit the edges and rivets of the metal with dots of Runefang Steel.
	</p>
	<p>
		When painting the next batch I think it would be better to shade the skin with a green wash directly after the primer to darken the crevices instead of this drybrush with a darker color. That also saves time. I would also wash the cloth with some Nuln Oil (maybe mixed in) to darken it a little more. The Agrax Earthshade does add grime but not that much contrast.

	<h1>Hellbrute WIP</h1>
		<p>
		<img src="img/hellbrute_wip.jpg" alt="Hellbrute WIP" width="80%"><br><span>Shaded, not highlighted.</span><br>
		I'm not sure how I can add some contrast here. For the base I want to keep it very simple and light concrete and try and paint some cracks under the stomping foot. Also the face needs some attention.

	<h1>Orktober 2018: I tried</h1>
	
	<p>But did not get all 15 Orruk Ardboys painted this month, I did finish the mighty Squig though! <img src="img/squig.jpg" alt="Squig"><br>
		The Ardboys "just" need some yellow layering for the armor and highlighting, shading and highlighting the shoulders and blue bits and same for the skulls. And of course basing. I'm going to base them the same as the Squigg, I like the autumn grass + leaves and the combination of the yellow and green.
