# Lecture 5
# CLI, Version Control, Standards
---

# Discuss homework

# Questions from you

---
# CLI

Command Line Interface

- Give commands to the OS using text
- Interact with programs without a GUI
- More expressive
- But more to memorize
- Everything is just bytes

---
# CLI Practice!

```bash
	# LiSt files
	ls
	# LiSt files (all, list mode, timestamp order, human)
	ls -alth
	# Print Working Directory
	pwd
	# print some text
	echo "Hello"
	# print some text, redirect to a file
	echo "Hello" > hello.txt
	# print contents of file
	cat hello.txt
	# browse a file
	less hello.txt
	# copy a file
	cp hello.txt hello2.txt
	# rename a file
	mv hello2.txt foo.txt
	# ReMove a file
	rm foo.txt
	# Change Directory
	cd ..

```

---
# CLI Practice!

Let's run some programs

```bash
	mysql
	ssh justine@interdictor.org / change1234
```

---
# Version Control

- Multiple people work on the same files
- History
- Branching

.w100[![B](branches.png)]

---

# Let's try Git!

```bash
	git config --list
	git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	git config --global user.email "you@domain.com"
	git config --list
```

Make a [Github account](https://github.com/join) & create a [new repository](https://github.com/new)

Create a public/private keypair
```bash
	ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@domain.com"
	eval (ssh-agent -c)
	ssh-add -l
	ssh-add YOUR_KEY
```
Copy the public key to your clipboard & add it to your [Github SSH keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)


---

# Git on the command line

```bash
	git clone YOUR_REPO
	# Copy your HTML recipe & photos to this directory
	git status
	git add --all
	git status
	git commit -m'My first html recipe'
	git status
	git checkout -b justine/new-recipe-veg-wellington
	git branch -a
	# add a file
	git add FILE
	git commit -m'MEANINGFUL_DESCRIPTION_HERE'
	git log
	git checkout master
	git log 
	# make a small change to your html file
	git add FILE
	git commit -m'MEANINGFUL_DESCRIPTION_HERE'
	git log
	git merge justine/new-recipe-veg-wellington
	git log --graph
	git push
	# let's check your repo on github
```

# Standards

.w100[![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)]

[XKCD](https://xkcd.com)

---
# Standards

- For different versions of things
	- HTML, HTTP, SQL, Go, JavaScript
	- Everything is terrible because it's the wrong version
	- Not everything supports all versions
- For standardizing on things
	- Time, Date, Currencies, Unicode
	- Everything is just terrible
	- At least it's consistent
- Usually volunteers!
- Don't memorize, just look it up

---
# Suffering

Let's read this article about [Leap second hiatus](https://fanf.dreamwidth.org/133823.html)

Your job:
- High level summary of why this matters
- Explain what the "technical words" in the article are

---
# Evaluation

# What interesting or boring?
# What was hard or easy?

---
 # Homework

 - Peruse some of [these paintings](https://classicprogrammerpaintings.com/) and find one or two that are amusing to you
 - Pixels are just 3 bytes: Red, Green and Blue. 24 Bits. Look at [Rainbow Smoke](http://rainbowsmoke.hu/home)
