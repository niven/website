# Computer Science

Study of 
- .em[algorithms]: a sequence of well-defined instructions to solve a problem
- Artificial Intelligence: systems that exhibit autonomous behaviour. "We didn't put it in."
- Communication &amp; Security (Cryptography)
- Computer architecture (Hardware)
- Computer graphics &amp; vision
- Programming languages &amp; compilers

# Boolean Logic

True, False

.w100[![Bitwise operators](bitops.png)]

---
# Binary: 0 1 &rarr; off on


.w100[![counting](counting.png)]

8 bits &rarr; 1 byte

---
# Addition

.w100[![add](add.png)]

---
# Half adder in hardware
.w100[![add](adder.png)]

Which bitwise operators do we need?

---
.h50[![Overview](hw.png)]

# Assembly

## opcodes: instructions for bytes
```go
ADD SUB MUL DIV
AND OR XOR
MOV
CMP JMP
```
Luckily, .em[compilers] translate programming languages into assembly, then assemblers translate that into microcode (1s and 0s) and then hardware does it's thing.

```go
var a = 5      &rarr; MOV AX, 5
a = a + 2      &rarr; ADD AX, 2
```

# Why learn Go?

- Straightforward
- Widely used
- Good tooling

# Programming 5

## ðŸ“¦ Variables
## ðŸ—„ Types
## ðŸ¤– Control structures
## ðŸ“‹ Statements
## ðŸ”„ Functions

---
# ðŸ“¦ Variables

A name for a value of a type

```go
var name string = "Justine"

var age int = 29

var is_adult bool = true
```

.fact[Name] is up to you

.fact[Type] is what kind of thing it is

.fact[Value] is what it actually is

---
# ðŸ—„ Types

Data is ultimately a bunch of bytes. But for programming we make higher level abstractions:

```go
bool           &rarr;   true, false

int            &rarr;   -10, 0, 123   

float64        &rarr;   3.1415

string         &rarr;   "Hello", "<html>"

[]int, []string, ... &rarr;   {3, 5, 7}, {"Yes", "No", "Maybe"}

map[int]string       &rarr;   { 3: "Wine", 7: "Beer" }
```


---
# ðŸ¤– Control structures

.fact[IF] making choices about what to do
```go
   if age > 18  {
      // can buy beer
   } else {
      // lemonade
   }
```
   
   
.fact[FOR] repeating things
```go
   sum := 0
   for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
      sum = sum + i
   }
```

---

# ðŸ“‹ Statements

Programs are nothing more than a bunch of statements

```go

   var min_age int = 18 // create a new variable
   var ages = [3]int{16, 15, 21} // array of 3 ints
   
   for i := 0; i < lngth(ages); i++ {
      if ages[i] >= min_age {
         fmt.Println("Can buy beer!")
      }
   }
```

Exercise: find the bug!


---
# ðŸ”„ Functions

Modern programming languages have functions to break things up.

```go

   func is_legal_drinking_age( age int ) bool {
      
      var legal bool = false
      
      if age >= 18 {
         legal = true
      }
      return legal
   }


   var min_age int = 18 // create a new variable
   var ages = [3]int{16, 15, 21} // array of 3 ints
   
   for i := 0; i < length(ages); i++ {
      if is_legal_drinking_age( ages[i] ) {
         fmt.Println("Can buy beer!")
      }
   }


```

# Congratulations! ðŸ¥³

That's all you need to know to write all possible software.

... but nobody writes code in assembly by hand anymore ðŸ˜¢

*Next Time on Go Programming: Text Editors, IDEs &amp libraries *

- Finish this program https://play.golang.org/p/3TcxpKKpJ4L (we can do it together)
- Reading: *The P vs NP problem* - https://anthonybonato.com/2018/06/20/the-p-vs-np-problem-2/
- Watch this talk by James Mickens *"Life As A Developer: My Code Does Not Work Because I Am A Victim Of Complex Societal Factors That Are Beyond My Control And Do Not Involve My Own Laziness"*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nj9ZjwOdFQ (30m)
